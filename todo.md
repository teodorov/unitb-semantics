# Todo #

    * tactic for monotonicity in predicate calculus
    * ~~reduce soundness of leads-to properties to assumptions about transient~~
	* ~~prove soundness of unitb.models.sched~~
	* prove that unitb.models.sched are inhabited
	* ~~in unitb.models.sched, give a rule that relies only on predicate
      calculus and UNITY logic~~
	* study model where the invariant is encoded in the state space
	* generalize transient_rule (from unity.models.nondet) and put in
      type class so that it becomes a requirement that other models
      can subscribe to
	* refinement
	  * schedules
	  * simulation
	  * splitting / merging
	  * data refinement
	* shared variable decomposition
